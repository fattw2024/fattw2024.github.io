      Welcome to the Future Advanced Testing Technology Workshop 2024!
    </div>
    <p class="pa pa-header p">
      Join us for FATTW 2024, a premier event dedicated to the latest advancements and innovations
      in testing technology. In an era where software complexity is ever-increasing, the role of
      advanced testing technologies has never been more critical. This workshop is dedicated to
      exploring the forefront of software testing innovations, with a special focus on the
      transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs).
    </p>

    <div class="title2 section-title">Why LLMs?</div>
    <p class="pa pa-header p">
      Large Language Models, such as GPT-4, have revolutionized various domains by leveraging their
      ability to understand and generate human-like text. In the realm of software testing, LLMs
      offer unprecedented capabilities:
    </p>
    <div class="pa pa-header p">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Automated Test Case Generation: LLMs can automatically generate comprehensive test cases
          from natural language requirements, significantly reducing manual effort and accelerating
          the testing process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced Bug Detection: By analyzing code and identifying potential issues, LLMs help in
          early detection of bugs, ensuring higher software quality and reliability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Intelligent Test Data Management: LLMs assist in creating and managing realistic test
          data, which is crucial for effective testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Integrating LLMs into CI/CD pipelines
          enhances the automation of testing tasks, leading to faster and more reliable software
          releases.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="pa pa-header p">
      This workshop is designed for software testing professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts who
